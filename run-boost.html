                <h2>What is a Run Boost?</h2>
                <p>
                    A run boost is an advanced team mechanic where one player uses their running momentum to launch a teammate higher and farther than a standard boost. Unlike traditional static boosts where both players remain stationary, run boosts involve coordinated movement and timing to achieve greater height and distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technique is particularly devastating in aggressive plays, allowing teams to reach unexpected positions with speed and surprise. Professional teams use run boosts to execute lightning-fast site takes or create chaos in enemy positions before defenders can react.

                <h3>How Run Boosting Works</h3>
                <p>
                    The physics behind run boosts utilize momentum transfer:
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Run Boost Execution</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Runner Setup:</strong> Bottom player runs at full speed toward boost spot</li>
                        <li><strong>Jumper Timing:</strong> Top player times jump to land on runner's head</li>
                        <li><strong>Momentum Transfer:</strong> Runner's velocity propels jumper higher and farther</li>
                        <li><strong>Landing:</strong> Jumper lands on elevated position with forward momentum</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Timing is everything. Both players must coordinate perfectly.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Run Boost vs. Standard Boost</h3>

                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Standard Boost</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Both players stationary</li>
                            <li>Vertical height gain only</li>
                            <li>Slower to execute</li>
                            <li>More stable platform</li>
                            <li>Easier to perform</li>
                            <li>Better for holding positions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Run Boost</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Movement required</li>
                            <li>Height AND distance</li>
                            <li>Rapid execution</li>
                            <li>Unstable, one-time use</li>
                            <li>High skill requirement</li>
                            <li>Offensive aggression tool</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Types of Run Boosts</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Forward Run Boost</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most common type where the runner moves forward while the jumper lands on their head. Used to reach elevated positions quickly or launch players into site. Runner continues moving forward while jumper gains vertical and horizontal distance.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Site entries, aggressive pushes, fast repositioning</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Corner Run Boost</h3>
                    <p>
                        Runner approaches a corner at speed while jumper uses the momentum to peek around or over obstacles. Extremely effective for surprising defenders holding static angles. The speed makes it nearly impossible to react to.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Breaking setups, overwhelming defenders, chaos creation</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Window Run Boost</h3>
                    <p>
                        Specialized run boost to launch players through windows or gaps. Requires precise timing and angle approach. Most notably used on Mirage mid window and various Cache positions. High risk but devastating when successful.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best For:</strong> Window entries, map control, surprise attacks</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Famous Run Boost Spots</h3>
                <p>
                    Specific positions where run boosts are commonly used in competitive play:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cache A Main:</strong> Run boost over fork for aggressive A site entry</li>
                    <li><strong>Mirage Mid:</strong> Boost into window for rapid mid control</li>
                    <li><strong>Dust II B Tunnels:</strong> Fast boost onto platform for surprise angles</li>
                    <li><strong>Inferno Banana:</strong> Quick boost to top of logs for aggressive B take</li>
                    <li><strong>Overpass Bathrooms:</strong> Run boost for instant B site pressure</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Timing and Communication</h3>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Perfect Coordination</h4>
                    <p><strong>Runner Calls:</strong> "Running in 3... 2... 1... GO"</p>
                    <p><strong>Jumper Response:</strong> "Ready" before countdown starts</p>
                    <p><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Jumper watches runner's movement to time jump</p>
                    <p><strong>Audio Timing:</strong> Listen for footsteps to synchronize</p>
                    <p>Failed timing results in missed boost and exposed positions. Practice is essential.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Strategic Applications</h3>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>When to Run Boost</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Fast Executes:</strong> Part of 5-man site takes where speed matters</li>
                        <li><strong>Anti-Eco Rounds:</strong> Overwhelming unarmored opponents with aggression</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Pressure:</strong> Late round scenarios requiring rapid position changes</li>
                        <li><strong>Breaking Setups:</strong> When defenders are set and expecting standard play</li>
                        <li><strong>First Round:</strong> Catching opponents in default positions</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Advanced Run Boost Techniques</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Double Run Boost</h3>
                    <p>
                        Two consecutive run boosts executed rapidly. First player gets boosted to position, second player immediately follows with another run boost. Creates overwhelming pressure with multiple attackers reaching elevated positions simultaneously.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Requires:</strong> Three players minimum, precise timing, excellent communication</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Run Boost Transfer</h3>
                    <p>
                        After being run boosted to position, the boosted player immediately engages while the runner transitions to a support role. Runner either follows up or holds flank. Maximizes the chaos created by the initial boost.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Runner must immediately shift roles after boost completes</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Risks and Counters</h3>

                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Run Boost Risks</h4>

                            <li>High timing requirement</li>
                            <li>Loud footsteps reveal intent</li>
                            <li>Both players vulnerable during setup</li>
                            <li>Difficult to abort mid-execution</li>
                            <li>Failure leaves team exposed</li>

                <h3>Practice Methods</h3>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Training Run Boosts</h4>
                    <p><strong>Private Server Practice:</strong> Use offline server with teammates to drill timing repeatedly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Countdown Method:</strong> Runner counts down to synchronize timing until automatic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Slow to Fast:</strong> Start with walking run boosts, gradually increase to full speed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Record Sessions:</strong> Record attempts to analyze timing issues and improve.</p>
                    <p><strong>Competitive Application:</strong> Try in casual or unranked before ranked matches.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Poor Timing:</strong> Jumper jumps too early or late, missing the boost</li>
                    <li><strong>Wrong Angle:</strong> Runner approaches from incorrect direction</li>
                    <li><strong>No Communication:</strong> Attempting without callouts leads to chaos</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed Variance:</strong> Runner must maintain consistent speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Jumper Hesitation:</strong> Second-guessing ruins timing</li>
                    <li><strong>No Backup Plan:</strong> No contingency if boost fails</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>💡 Professional Usage</h4>
                    <p>
                        In professional CS2, run boosts are often part of set plays practiced hundreds of times. Teams like FaZe Clan and NAVI have signature run boost plays that they execute with perfect precision. The surprise factor alone can win crucial rounds, making run boosts a valuable tool in any team's tactical arsenal.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Map-Specific Run Boosts</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Mirage Palace to Ramp</h3>
                    <p>
                        Runner sprints from palace while jumper times landing perfectly to reach ramp elevation. This provides an unexpected angle on A site defenders and can completely break CT setups. Requires perfect synchronization but is devastating when executed.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Inferno Apartments Entry</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fast run boost to reach elevated positions in apartments for aggressive B site pressure. The speed denies CT players time to set up proper crossfires. Often combined with utility to create overwhelming offensive pressure.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Economic Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Run boosts work best in certain economic situations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full Buy Advantage:</strong> When your team has better weapons and armor</li>
                    <li><strong>Anti-Eco:</strong> Overwhelming weaker opponents with speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Momentum Rounds:</strong> After winning previous rounds, maintain pressure</li>
                    <li><strong>Desperation:</strong> Eco rounds where chaos might create opportunities</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>⚠️ Important Note</h4>
                    <p>
                        Run boosts are high-risk, high-reward plays. They should be used sparingly to maintain surprise advantage. Once opponents know your team uses run boosts, they'll anticipate and counter them. Save them for critical rounds where the element of surprise can turn the tide.
                    </p>
