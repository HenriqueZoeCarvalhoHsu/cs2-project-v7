                <h2>What is Crosshair Placement?</h2>
                <p>
                    Crosshair placement is one of the most fundamental mechanics in Counter-Strike 2. It refers to keeping your aim (crosshair) at the exact height and position where enemies are most likely to appear — typically at head level. 
                    Proper crosshair placement allows you to react faster and land instant headshots without needing to adjust your aim vertically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a game where milliseconds decide who wins a duel, good crosshair placement gives you the advantage of reaction time. Instead of flicking your mouse to the enemy’s head, your crosshair is already there, ready to shoot the moment they appear.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Crosshair Placement Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Every professional player in CS2 has near-perfect crosshair placement. It’s not flashy — but it’s the secret behind consistent headshots and fast kills. Bad aim can be improved with practice, but poor crosshair placement limits your potential at any skill level.

                    <h4>Impact on Gameplay</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reaction Time:</strong> Reduces aiming delay by up to 200ms</li>
                        <li><strong>Headshot Accuracy:</strong> Higher consistency in duels</li>
                        <li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Anticipates enemy locations naturally</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> You’re always ready to shoot instantly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Key Principles of Crosshair Placement</h3>
                <p>
                    The core idea is simple: always keep your crosshair at <strong>head level</strong> and <strong>aim where enemies will appear</strong>. This transforms aiming from a reaction into a pre-planned action.
                </p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Head Level</h4>
                        <p>Always maintain your crosshair at the approximate height of an enemy’s head, regardless of your position on the map. This eliminates vertical adjustment when you encounter an opponent.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Pre-Aiming</h4>
                        <p>Keep your crosshair aimed at likely enemy spots — corners, common angles, and choke points — before they appear. This lets you “peek” ready to fire instantly.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Practice Crosshair Placement</h3>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Training Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Walk Around Maps:</strong> Load into a map alone and move around while keeping your crosshair at head level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Aim Corners:</strong> As you approach a corner, imagine an enemy standing there — aim exactly where their head would be.</li>
                        <li><strong>Peek Practice:</strong> Use workshop maps to practice pre-aiming and peeking correctly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Review Demos:</strong> Watch your own games to notice when your crosshair drifts too low or too high.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanics-grid">
                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Aiming at the Ground</h3>
                        <p>Beginners often keep their crosshair too low, aiming at the chest or legs. Always align at head height — headshots win fights instantly.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Late Adjustments</h3>
                        <p>If you need to move your crosshair up when seeing an enemy, you’re already too late. The goal is to eliminate vertical correction.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Ignoring Common Angles</h3>
                        <p>Don’t let your crosshair wander. As you move through maps, always align it with typical enemy positions and cover spots.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Not Adapting to Elevation</h3>
                        <p>Enemies can be on stairs, ramps, or boxes. Adjust head height dynamically to match elevation changes.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Crosshair Placement by Scenario</h3>

                <div class="two-column">
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Peeking Corners</h4>
                        <p>Pre-aim at the enemy’s head before you expose yourself. As you strafe out, your crosshair should already be on target — no mouse movement needed.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Holding Angles</h4>
                        <p>Keep your crosshair exactly where an enemy’s head would appear from cover. Don’t aim too wide or too tight — align with the edge of the wall.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Map Awareness & Pre-Aiming</h3>
                <p>
                    Good crosshair placement comes from map knowledge. You must learn where enemies typically stand and how to pre-aim those locations. As you get more familiar with each map, your crosshair naturally moves to those spots.
                </p>

                    <h4>Tips by Map</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mirage:</strong> Aim head-level at stairs, jungle, and connector peeks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inferno:</strong> Keep crosshair aligned for banana corners and archway holds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dust2:</strong> Practice head-level on long doors and mid boxes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Advanced Crosshair Placement</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Pre-Firing Spots</h3>
                    <p>Once your crosshair placement is consistent, start pre-firing common positions. This combines accuracy and prediction to catch opponents off guard.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Dynamic Crosshair Placement</h3>
                    <p>Adjust your crosshair mid-fight as you move. Anticipate enemy repositioning and pre-aim their possible new locations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Team Coordination</h3>
                    <p>Use proper crosshair placement alongside teammate callouts — pre-aim based on enemy positions communicated by your team.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Measure Improvement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Headshot %:</strong> Track how often your first bullets hit the head.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flicks Needed:</strong> The fewer flicks you make, the better your crosshair placement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Keep head-level crosshair regardless of movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> You’ll start winning more duels with less effort.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Final Advice</h4>
                    <p>
                        Perfect crosshair placement turns aiming into predicting. You’re not reacting — you’re already prepared. Combine it with movement control and game sense, and your performance will skyrocket. Like all CS2 fundamentals, it’s built on discipline and repetition.
