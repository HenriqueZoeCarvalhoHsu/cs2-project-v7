                <h2>Understanding Pre-firing</h2>
                <p>
                    Pre-firing is the technique of shooting at common positions before actually seeing an enemy, based on probability, sound cues, or game sense. It's a high-level skill that combines map knowledge, pattern recognition, and risk assessment to gain crucial milliseconds in gunfights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When executed correctly, pre-firing eliminates the enemy's reaction time advantage. Instead of peeking, seeing, aiming, and shooting, you're already firing as you peek. This reduces your time-to-kill by 200-400ms—often the difference between winning and losing the duel.
                </p>

                <h3>When to Pre-fire</h3>
                <p>
                    Pre-firing isn't random spraying—it's calculated aggression based on:
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Pre-fire Triggers</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sound Information:</strong> Heard footsteps or utility from specific location</li>
                        <li><strong>Common Positions:</strong> Known default holding angles on every map</li>
                        <li><strong>Previous Rounds:</strong> Enemy repeatedly uses same position</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Pressure:</strong> Late round where enemies must be in certain areas</li>
                        <li><strong>Teammate Calls:</strong> Spotted but not yet visible to you</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Map Knowledge is Essential</h3>
                <p>
                    Effective pre-firing requires intimate knowledge of common positions on each map. Every map has 20-30 spots where players commonly hold or hide. Professional players have these memorized and automatically pre-fire them during executes or retakes.
                </p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>High-Priority Pre-fire Spots</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Head glitch positions</li>
                            <li>Default holding angles</li>

                <h3>Types of Pre-firing</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Wide Angle Pre-fire</h3>
                    <p>
                        Used when peeking wide around corners where enemies commonly hold. You wide peek while already firing at head level where you expect them. This combines peekers advantage with offensive aggression, giving you maximum benefit.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Rushing, aggressive entries, catching passive defenders</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Tight Angle Pre-fire</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pre-firing very close to walls or corners where enemies might be hiding. Requires precise crosshair placement and map knowledge. Often used when clearing close angles or cubby positions.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Clearing close corners, anti-eco rounds, post-plant checks</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Wallbang Pre-fire</h3>
                    <p>
                        Shooting through walls or surfaces at common positions. Some materials in CS2 allow bullet penetration. Knowing these spots and pre-firing them can secure unexpected kills and psychological advantages.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Default positions behind cover, common camp spots, predictable holds</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Smoke Fade Pre-fire</h3>
                    <p>
                        As smokes begin to fade, pre-fire through the thinning smoke at likely positions. This catches enemies off-guard as they're waiting for full smoke dissipation. Extremely effective in late-round situations.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Attacking through smokes, retake situations, time pressure scenarios</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Risk vs. Reward</h3>
                <p>
                    Pre-firing has risks that must be managed:
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Advantages</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eliminates enemy reaction time advantage</li>
                        <li>Punishes predictable positioning</li>
                        <li>Creates fear and uncertainty in opponents</li>
                        <li>Works exceptionally well with peekers advantage</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reveals your position through gunfire</li>
                        <li>Wastes ammunition if wrong</li>
                        <li>May need reload during critical moment</li>
                        <li>Gives away timing and intentions</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Advanced Pre-fire Techniques</h3>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
                    <p>
                        Watch for enemy patterns. If someone holds the same angle three rounds in a row, pre-fire it on the fourth. Professional players actively track opponent tendencies and exploit them with well-timed pre-fires.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Common Pre-fire Positions by Map</h3>
                <p>
                    While every map has dozens of pre-fire spots, here are examples of must-know positions:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dust II:</strong> Long corner, CT spawn boxes, car on long, goose, default box</li>
                    <li><strong>Mirage:</strong> Jungle, stairs, CT, default on A site, bench on B</li>
                    <li><strong>Inferno:</strong> Truck, new box, pit, spools, dark cubby</li>
                    <li><strong>Overpass:</strong> Toxic, truck, graffiti, water, short</li>
                    <li><strong>Nuke:</strong> Hut, silo, rafters, heaven, squeaky</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Training Pre-fires</h4>
                    <p><strong>Offline Practice:</strong> Use "bot_place" command to position bots at common spots, then practice pre-firing while peeking.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pre-fire Maps:</strong> Workshop has dedicated pre-fire training maps for each competitive map.</p>
                    <p><strong>Demo Review:</strong> Watch how professionals pre-fire during their matches. Note which spots they prioritize.</p>
                    <p><strong>Deathmatch Application:</strong> Practice pre-firing in DM servers where players use predictable positions.</p>

                <h3>Combining Pre-fire with Other Mechanics</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Pre-fire + Wide Peek</h3>
                    <p>
                        The deadliest combination. Wide peek at full running speed while pre-firing the angle. Maximum peekers advantage combined with offensive pressure. Used by entry fraggers constantly.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Pre-fire + Flash</h3>
                    <p>
                        Flash a position, then immediately pre-fire it as you peek. Even if they dodge the flash, your pre-fire catches them off-guard. If they're flashed, it's a guaranteed kill.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Pre-fire + Strafe</h3>
                    <p>
                        Strafe peek while pre-firing, making yourself a moving target while still applying offensive pressure. Requires excellent counter-strafing between bursts.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Reading the Game</h3>
                <p>
                    Elite pre-firing comes from reading subtle game cues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Eco rounds mean hiding in unexpected corners</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> Late round limits possible positions dramatically</li>
                    <li><strong>Utility Usage:</strong> Smoke or molotov usage reveals likely positions</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Numbers:</strong> Man advantage makes aggressive pre-fires safer</li>
                    <li><strong>Psychological Reads:</strong> Tilted or desperate enemies play predictably</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>💡 Professional Secret</h4>
                    <p>
                        Top players pre-fire based on incomplete information all the time. A 60% chance of someone being there is enough to pre-fire if the tactical situation demands aggression. It's not about being certain—it's about maximizing your odds in every engagement.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>When NOT to Pre-fire</h3>
                <p>
                    Knowing when to avoid pre-firing is equally important:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low Ammunition:</strong> Don't waste bullets you might desperately need</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent Approach:</strong> When stealth is more valuable than aggression</li>
                    <li><strong>Outnumbered:</strong> Revealing position when at numerical disadvantage</li>
                    <li><strong>No Information:</strong> Random pre-fires with zero basis are wasteful</li>
                    <li><strong>Clutch Situations:</strong> Often better to play patiently and precisely</li>
                </ul>
