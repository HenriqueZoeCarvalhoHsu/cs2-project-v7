                <h2>What is Jiggle Peeking?</h2>
                <p>
                    Jiggle peeking is an advanced movement technique where players rapidly peek and unpeak from cover using quick A-D strafing movements. This technique allows you to gather information about enemy positions while presenting an extremely difficult target to hit. It's particularly effective against AWPers and players holding static angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When executed properly, jiggle peeking makes you appear for only a fraction of a second—barely enough time for enemies to react, let alone shoot accurately. Professional players use this technique constantly to safely check angles without committing to full peeks.
                </p>

                <h3>The Mechanics Behind It</h3>
                <p>
                    Jiggle peeking relies on fast strafing combined with peekers advantage and network latency. On your screen, you see around corners before defenders see you on theirs. By immediately returning to cover, you deny them the opportunity to shoot back effectively.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Key Components</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quick Strafing:</strong> Rapid A-D-A-D movement around corners</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimal Exposure:</strong> Only expose yourself for 0.2-0.3 seconds</li>
                        <li><strong>Peekers Advantage:</strong> You see enemies before they see you</li>
                        <li><strong>Information Gathering:</strong> Spot enemies without committing to fights</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>How to Perform Jiggle Peeks</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Position Near Cover:</strong> Stand close to the wall or corner you'll peek from</li>
                    <li><strong>Strafe Out (D):</strong> Quickly tap D to peek right side of cover</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate Return (A):</strong> Instantly tap A to return to safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue A-D pattern to gather more information</li>
                    <li><strong>Counter-Strafe:</strong> Use proper counter-strafing if you want to shoot during peek</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Timing is Critical</h4>
                    <p>The effectiveness of jiggle peeking depends on speed. Each peek should be extremely brief—just long enough to see what's there. Think of it as "flickering" in and out of view rather than peeking.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Types of Jiggle Peeks</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Information Jiggle</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pure information gathering with no intention to shoot. Use this to safely check if anyone is holding an angle. Extremely fast peeks that don't even stop to aim. Perfect for checking AWP positions or confirming enemy locations before committing teammates.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Combat Jiggle</h3>
                    <p>
                        Slightly slower peeks where you counter-strafe and potentially fire. Each peek is an opportunity to take a shot. Alternate between peeking and shooting, making yourself difficult to hit while still applying pressure. Requires excellent counter-strafing skills.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Shoulder Peek</h3>
                <p>
                        An extreme version where only your shoulder model is visible. Used specifically to bait AWP shots without exposing yourself to danger. After the AWPer misses, you can aggressively peek while they're scoped out or reloading.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Advanced Applications</h3>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Against AWPs</h4>
                        <p>Jiggle peeking is devastating against AWPs because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AWPs need time to react and shoot</li>
                            <li>Missing punishes them with reload time</li>
                            <li>You can bait shots and immediately punish</li>
                            <li>Forces AWPer to reposition or give up angle</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Against Rifles</h4>
                        <p>Still effective but requires different approach:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Faster peeks required</li>
                            <li>More emphasis on shoulder peeks</li>
                            <li>Can't bait shots as reliably</li>
                            <li>Use to gather info before wide peek</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Jiggle Peek Combos</h3>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Effective Combinations</h4>
                    <p><strong>Jiggle → Wide Peek:</strong> Jiggle peek to spot enemy position, immediately wide peek to catch them aiming at your previous position.</p>
                    <p><strong>Jiggle → Flash → Peek:</strong> Jiggle peek to confirm presence, throw flash, then aggress during blindness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Double Jiggle:</strong> Jiggle twice from same position to bait reaction, then wide peek third time when they expect another jiggle.</p>
                    <p><strong>Multi-Angle Jiggle:</strong> Jiggle peek multiple angles rapidly to confuse defenders about where you'll commit.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Peeking Too Wide:</strong> Exposing too much of your body defeats the purpose</li>
                    <li><strong>Too Slow:</strong> If enemy can track and shoot you, it's not a jiggle peek</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictable Rhythm:</strong> Varying your timing makes it harder to predict</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Using Information:</strong> Jiggle peeking is worthless if you don't act on what you learn</li>
                    <li><strong>Overusing:</strong> Good players will predict and pre-fire jiggle peeks</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Practice Drills</h4>
                    <p><strong>Bot Practice:</strong> Set up bots holding angles and practice jiggle peeking without getting hit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Timing Test:</strong> Record yourself jiggle peeking and count frames of exposure. Aim for under 10 frames at 60 FPS.</p>
                    <p><strong>Peek Variations:</strong> Practice wide peeks, jiggle peeks, and shoulder peeks from the same position to build variety.</p>
                    <p><strong>Live Practice:</strong> Use in deathmatch against real players to test effectiveness under pressure.</p>

                <h3>Countering Jiggle Peeks</h3>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to counter jiggle peeks makes you a better player:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't Overcommit:</strong> Don't waste shots on jiggle peeks</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Fire Timing:</strong> Anticipate the peek and pre-fire</li>
                    <li><strong>Reposition:</strong> After being jiggle peeked, change your angle</li>
                    <li><strong>Utility Usage:</strong> Molotov or grenade the peeking position</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggressive Counter:</strong> Push through their jiggle peek while they're out of position</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>💡 Pro Tip: Shoulder Baiting AWPs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Against AWPs, show just your shoulder by barely peeking. Most AWPers will instinctively shoot at any movement. Once they miss, you have a 1-2 second window where they're vulnerable. This is when you either wide peek aggressively or call for teammates to push.
                    </p>

                <h3>CS2 Specific Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    The subtick system in CS2 affects jiggle peeking:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>More Precise Registration:</strong> Peeks must be faster than in CS:GO</li>
                    <li><strong>Peekers Advantage Adjusted:</strong> Slightly different timing windows</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement Feel:</strong> Source 2 movement feels different, requiring adaptation</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Skill Ceiling:</strong> Proper execution is more rewarding</li>
                </ul>
