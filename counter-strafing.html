                <h2>What is Counter-Strafing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Counter-strafing is the single most important mechanic in Counter-Strike 2 that every competitive player must master. It's the technique of instantly stopping your movement by tapping the opposite movement key, allowing you to shoot with perfect accuracy immediately. Without proper counter-strafing, your shots will be wildly inaccurate due to movement penalties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In CS2, even the slightest movement causes significant accuracy loss. Simply releasing your movement key leaves you coasting with momentum for a brief moment. Counter-strafing eliminates this momentum instantly by applying force in the opposite direction, bringing your velocity to zero and restoring full accuracy.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Counter-Strafing is Essential</h3>
                <p>
                    The difference between counter-strafing and not counter-strafing is often the difference between winning and losing gunfights. Professional players counter-strafe in literally every engagement—it's so fundamental that it becomes unconscious muscle memory.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Impact on Gameplay</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Instant first-shot accuracy vs. delayed accuracy</li>
                        <li><strong>Time-to-Kill:</strong> 200-300ms faster kills compared to no counter-strafe</li>
                        <li><strong>Duels:</strong> Win percentage increases dramatically with proper execution</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Reliable performance across all weapons and ranges</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>The Physics Behind It</h3>
                <p>
                    When you move in Counter-Strike 2, your character has velocity. Simply letting go of your movement key doesn't stop you instantly due to momentum. Your character continues sliding briefly. Counter-strafing works by pressing the opposite direction key, which applies immediate counterforce, canceling your velocity in milliseconds.
                </p>

                <h3>How to Counter-Strafe</h3>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>Directional Counter-Strafing</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Moving Right (D):</strong> Tap A to stop instantly</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Left (A):</strong> Tap D to stop instantly</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Forward (W):</strong> Tap S to stop instantly</li>
                        <li><strong>Moving Backward (S):</strong> Tap W to stop instantly</li>
                        <li><strong>Diagonal Movement:</strong> Tap both opposite keys simultaneously</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Tutorial</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start Moving:</strong> Hold D to strafe right at full speed</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Target:</strong> See enemy or angle you want to check</li>
                    <li><strong>Counter-Strafe:</strong> Quick tap of A key (opposite direction)</li>
                    <li><strong>Shoot:</strong> Fire immediately when velocity hits 0</li>
                    <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Resume movement or repeat process</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Timing is Everything</h3>
                <p>
                    The tap duration is critical. You don't hold the opposite key—you tap it briefly. Holding too long causes you to start moving in the opposite direction, ruining your accuracy again. The goal is a quick tap that zeros your velocity without initiating movement.
                </p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <h4>Perfect Timing Practice</h4>
                    <p><strong>Enable Velocity Display:</strong> Type "cl_showpos 1" in console to see your current velocity.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Your velocity should read close to 0.00 when you shoot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Strafe left and right while watching velocity, counter-strafing to reach 0.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shoot on Zero:</strong> Only fire when velocity is at or near zero for maximum accuracy.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanics-grid">
                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Not Counter-Strafing</h3>
                        <p>
                            The #1 mistake among beginners. Shooting while moving or just releasing the key without counter-strafing. This results in wildly inaccurate shots and lost gunfights you should win.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Holding Too Long</h3>
                        <p>
                            Holding the opposite key too long makes you start moving in the new direction. Your velocity goes from positive to negative, missing the zero point entirely. Quick taps only.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Shooting Too Early</h3>
                        <p>
                            Shooting before velocity reaches zero. Even if you counter-strafe, firing too early still catches movement inaccuracy. Wait that extra millisecond for perfect accuracy.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                        <h3>❌ Forgetting Under Pressure</h3>
                        <p>
                            Remembering in practice but forgetting during intense matches. Counter-strafing must become muscle memory through thousands of repetitions until it's automatic.
                        </p>

                <h3>Advanced Counter-Strafing Techniques</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>ADAD Counter-Strafing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rapidly alternating between A and D while counter-strafing perfectly at each direction change. This creates an unpredictable movement pattern while maintaining the ability to shoot accurately at any moment. Elite players can ADAD at high speed while landing shots consistently.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Dueling, holding angles, making yourself difficult to hit</p>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Peeking with Counter-Strafe</h3>
                    <p>
                        Combining peeks with perfect counter-strafing. Strafe out from cover, counter-strafe the moment you spot an enemy, shoot accurately, then strafe back behind cover. This minimizes exposure time while maintaining offensive pressure.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Aggressive peeks, information gathering, trading kills</p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Wide Peek Counter-Strafe</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wide peeking at full speed, then counter-strafing the instant you see an enemy. The combination of peekers advantage and instant accurate shots makes this extremely deadly. Your opponent sees you later and you're already shooting accurately.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Entry fragging, catching off-guard enemies, aggressive plays</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Counter-Strafing by Weapon Type</h3>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>Rifles (AK/M4)</h4>
                        <p><strong>Critical Importance:</strong> Rifles have severe movement inaccuracy. Counter-strafing is absolutely mandatory for rifles. Even slight movement makes bullets spray wildly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Sharp, quick counter-strafe taps. Wait for complete stop before shooting.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <h4>SMGs/Pistols</h4>
                        <p><strong>More Forgiving:</strong> SMGs and pistols have better movement accuracy, but counter-strafing still improves effectiveness significantly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Can be less precise but still benefits from proper counter-strafing, especially at range.</p>

                <h3>Counter-Strafing in Combat Scenarios</h3>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Holding Angles</h3>
                    <p>
                        When holding an angle, slight ADAD movements keep you mobile. The instant an enemy appears, counter-strafe and shoot. This gives you movement advantage while maintaining instant-response capability.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Entry Fragging</h3>
                    <p>
                        As an entry fragger, you're constantly peeking and counter-strafing. Peek an angle at speed, counter-strafe when you spot someone, get the kill, continue to next angle. Speed and accuracy combined.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="sub-mechanic-card">
                    <h3>Clutch Situations</h3>
                    <p>
                        In clutch scenarios, movement efficiency is critical. Counter-strafing allows you to check angles quickly while maintaining ability to shoot accurately if threats appear. Every millisecond saved matters.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>CS2 Subtick System Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Counter-Strike 2 introduced the subtick system, which affects counter-strafing mechanics:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>More Precise Registration:</strong> The subtick system registers input between server ticks, making counter-strafing feel more responsive</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing Adjustments:</strong> Slightly different timing compared to CS:GO, requiring some adaptation</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> More consistent behavior across different server tick rates</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher Skill Ceiling:</strong> Perfect counter-strafing is more rewarding in CS2</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>💡 Professional Secret</h4>
                    <p>
                        Watch any professional player's POV and you'll notice they counter-strafe in literally every single engagement. It's so ingrained that they do it unconsciously, even when unnecessary. This level of automation frees mental resources for tactics, positioning, and decision-making. Your goal should be to reach this same level of unconscious competence.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Measuring Your Progress</h3>

                    <h4>Final Advice</h4>
                    <p>
                        Counter-strafing is not optional—it's mandatory for competitive CS2. Spend dedicated practice time every single day until it becomes as natural as breathing. The pros make it look easy because they've done it millions of times. You need to do the same. There are no shortcuts. Practice, practice, practice.
